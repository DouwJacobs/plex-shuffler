## Motivation

Shuffled TV show playlists offer a thrilling and spontaneous way to experience your favorite shows. By mixing up the order of episodes and blending different genres and themes, you open yourself up to the joy of rediscovery. You never know what episode will come next, creating an exciting sense of unpredictability.

The shuffled episodes gives you the feel of a TV channel where you watch different shows but the episodes within each show follows sequentially!
